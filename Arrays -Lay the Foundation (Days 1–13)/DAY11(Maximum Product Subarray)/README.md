# ðŸŒŸMaximum Product Subarray

## ðŸ“œProblem Statement

Given an array arr[] containing both positive and negative integers (may include 0), find the maximum product of any subarray in arr. It is guaranteed that the result fits in a 32-bit integer.

---

## Function Description

**Function**:
The function maxProduct(int[] arr) returns the maximum product of any subarray.

---

### **Input Format**

- arr[]: An array of integers, where 1â‰¤arr.size()â‰¤10^6.
- Array elements: âˆ’10â‰¤arr[i]â‰¤10.

---

### **Output Format**

- A single integer representing the maximum product of a subarray.

---

## ðŸ“Š Examples

### Example 1

#### Input:

```
arr[] = [-2, 6, -3, -10, 0, 2]

```

**Output:**

```java
180
```

### Explanation:

Subarray {6, -3, -10} gives the maximum product 6Ã—(âˆ’3)Ã—(âˆ’10)=180.

---

### Example 2

#### Input:

```
arr[] = [-1, -3, -10, 0, 6]

```

**Output:**

```java
30
```

### Explanation:

Subarray {-3, -10} gives the maximum product (âˆ’3)Ã—(âˆ’10)=30.

## ðŸ§  Approach and Solution

1. Initialization:

   - Maintain three variables:
     - maxProduct to store the global maximum product.
     - currMax to store the current maximum product at each index.
     - currMin to store the current minimum product (important for handling negatives).

2. Iterate Through Array:

   - For each element, calculate:
     - tempMax = currMax (to preserve the previous value of currMax).
     - currMax = max(arr[i], tempMax _ arr[i], currMin _ arr[i]).
     - currMin = min(arr[i], tempMax _ arr[i], currMin _ arr[i]).
     - Update maxProduct to be the maximum of itself and currMax.

3. Return the value of maxProduct.

### Constraints:

```
1 â‰¤ arr.size() â‰¤ 10^6
-10 â‰¤ arr[i] â‰¤ 10
```

# Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n) Single traversal of the array.
- Space Complexity: O(1), We only use a few variables (No additional data structures are used).
