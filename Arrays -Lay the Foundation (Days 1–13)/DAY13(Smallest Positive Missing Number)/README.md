### Example 1

#### Input:

```
arr = [2, -3, 4, 1, 1, 7]

```

**Output:**

```java
3
```

### Explanation:

Smallest positive missing number is 3.

### Example 2

#### Input:

```
arr[] = [5, 3, 2, 5, 1]

```

**Output:**

```java
4
```

### Explanation:

Smallest positive missing number is 4.

## üß† Approach and Solution

**Approach 1 :**

**1. Sorting:** First, the array is sorted in ascending order to arrange elements systematically.
**2. Tracking the smallest positive number (count):** Start with count = 1 since the smallest positive number is always 1.
**3. Iterating through the array:** For each element:

- If count matches the current element, increment count by 1 (indicating the next smallest positive number is needed).
  **4. Return the result:** Once the iteration finishes, return the final value of count, which represents the smallest missing positive number.

---

**Appraoch 2 :**

**1. Remove negative numbers:** Ignore all negative numbers since the smallest positive number starts from 1.
**2. Hashing technique:** Use a boolean array to mark which numbers exist in the array.
**3. Identify the smallest missing number:** Iterate over the boolean array to find the first missing index.

### Constraints:

```
1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5
-10^5 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10^5
```

# Time Complexity

Approach 1 :

- Time complexity : O(n log n) - for sorting (n log n) and traversing the array once(n).
- Space complexity : O(1) - No additional Data structure is used.

Approach 2:

- Time complexity : O(n) - for Traversing only once at.
- Space complexity : O(n) - using hashing technique to store only positive number
