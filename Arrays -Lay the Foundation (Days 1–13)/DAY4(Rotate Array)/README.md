# Rotate an Array by d - Counterclockwise or LeftðŸ”„

## Problem Statement

Given an array and a number d, `rotate the array to the right by d steps`, where n can be less than or equal to the size of the array. The rotation means the elements shift, and the last elements wrap around to the start.

## Function Description

**Function Name:**

```
rotateArr(arr, d)

**Input:**

arr â€“ Array of integers.
d â€“ Number of positions to rotate.

**Output:**
The array after rotation.
```

---

### **Input Format**

- An integer array arr of size n.
- An integer d representing the rotation count.

---

### **Output Format**

- An array with elements rotated by d positions to the right.

## ðŸ“Š Examples

### Example 1

#### Input:

```
arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6},
d = 2

```

**Output:**

```java
{3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}
```

### Explanation:

After first left rotation, arr[] becomes {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1} and after the second rotation, arr[] becomes {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2}

### Example 2

#### Input

```
arr[] = {1, 2, 3},
d = 4
```

**Output:**

```java
{2, 3, 1}
```

#### Explanation:

- After first left rotation, arr[] = {2, 3, 1}
- After second left rotation, arr[] = {3, 1, 2}
- After third left rotation, arr[] = {1, 2, 3}
- After fourth left rotation, arr[] = {2, 3, 1}

## ðŸ§  Approach and Solution

1. Modulo Operation: If d >= n, normalize d using d = d % n.
2. Reverse Method:
   - Reverse the first d elements.
   - Reverse the last n - d elements.
   - Reverse the entire array.
3. This ensures the elements are rotated in-place.

---

### Constraints:

```
1<=arr.size(), d <=10^5
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
```

# Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: O(n), as the array is traversed multiple times for reversal.
- Space Complexity: O(1), as no extra space is used.
