# GFG 160 Series Challenge üöÄ

This repository contains my Java solutions for the [GFG 160 Series Challenge](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/courses/gfg-160-series) organized by **GeeksforGeeks**. Through this challenge, I aim to enhance my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core algorithms and data structures.

## üìñ About the Challenge

The **GFG 160 Series** is a set of handpicked problems designed to challenge and build expertise in computer science concepts, algorithms, and data structures. This repository serves as a record of my journey and progress.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

The repository is organized day-wise, with each day's solution in its own folder:

- **DayX/** folders contain the Java solution(s) for that day.
- Each file is named descriptively for easy reference.
